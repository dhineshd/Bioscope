BIOSCOPE

Bioscope is a video app that can be used to shoot the same event from multiple angles and seamlessly stitch it together 
to produce a video with all the perspectives.

This was a team effort with contributions from the following folks:

1. Rohit Raghunathan
2. Rohan Raghunathan
3. Sanskriti Ayyar
4. Jenn Berney
5. Dhinesh Dharman

The app is not actively maintained but can be found here:
